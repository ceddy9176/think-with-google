### Think with google v2 12/12/17

### Author: Connor Miller

## Description

This site is a close match to thinkwithgoogle.com's latest trends and stories section as I could get. I originally tried to use a new framework that I found called Semantic-UI but that didn't turn out so great so now instead of using a framework I'll be using CSS Grid.

## Instructions

1. Clone project with git clone https://github.com/ceddy9176/think-with-google.git
2. open project by opening the repository and selecting index.html
3. view with google chrome
